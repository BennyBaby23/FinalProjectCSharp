# FinalProject

I have created a small Buy guide website! Which purpose is to help customer with their shopping.

describe roles authentication and authorization related to the theme/website. I.E., which controllers did you decide to force authentication & authorization and why
 
 Ans} I have decide to put authencation role on the payment info because it is something that should kept to be private and confidential.
 And i have also put authication on the customer infomation cause it is also should be kept private.
